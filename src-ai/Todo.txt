New todo
========

high, blocking publication:

medium/low, suboptimal:
- add mod name + version to name of buildtable cachefile
- losmap needs to support los reservations otherwise scouts go same way
- issue with metal/energy decisions
- workflow stalls occasionally

usability:
- add parameters to welcome message, like %configfilepath, %workflowdirectory
  %modname
- make gui non-default, so works full-screen and / or detect full-screen
  and disactivate it
  - checked on ubuntu: it just switches to non fullscreen automatically
    - still, there is some issue it seems, to be monitored

done:
- add welcome messages:
   - supported mod (Basic Annihilation)
   - how to enter debug mode
   - config file
   - (gui mode)
   - workflow configuration
- move buildEconomy workflow stuff into xml files
- enemytracker needs to track mobile units too, otherwise tankcontroller doesn't work
- issue with movementareaas for search etc

to communicate:
- get rid of debug and logging in java interface
- Java AI in spring from git very slow!
- getPos() to return null if not in los

to communicate, done:
- exact command to get linedrawer crash
- command to crash spring, when too many lines are drawn
- performance of getDef() and getPos()

- crash with line drawer / how to draw lines that only last a few seconds? 
   or how  to draw lines and then delete them a few seconds later? or
   how to remove all lines on the map?


High level methods:
- take a group of units, say to someone "attack the enemy with these"
- take a group of units, say to someone "attack here with this"
- take a list of unit types, say to someone "attack the enemy with these types"
- take a list of unit types, say to someoen "scout the enemy with these"
- say to someone "attack the enemy, build what you need, request through me".
   - have a priority, or a percentage allocation, or a total allocation, for this
